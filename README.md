Machine Learning mini-projects

Linear_Regression
* visualized relationships between dependent and independent variables
* explored implementations in statsmodels and sklearn
* plotted residuals and judged performance with mean squared error
* used 4-fold cross validation

Logistic_Regression
* visualized features and target relationships
* conducted cross-validated gridsearch with custom and sklearn's implementations
    - identified and selected opitmal C regularization parameter, based on mean accuracy score
* perfromance was comparable with a slight edge to the sklearn implementation

Clustering
* Customer Segmentation 
* clustered customer purchases based on marketing sale campaigns for different wine varietys
* explored different methods for choosing k in k-Means clustering
* Using PCA, performed dimensionality reduction of customer orders
* Visualized data, clusters, PCA components, and associated metrics
* tested a variety of other cluster algorithms in scikit-learn
