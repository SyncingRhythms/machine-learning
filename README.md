Machine Learning mini-projects

Linear_Regression
* visualized relationships between dependent and independent variables
* explored implementations in statsmodels and sklearn
* plotted residuals and judged performance with mean squared error
* used 4-fold cross validation

Logistic_Regression
* visualized data relationships and classes
* conducted cross-validated gridsearch with manual and sklearn's implementations
    -identified and selected opitmal $C$ regularization based on mean accuracy score
* perfromance was comparable with a slight edge to the sklearn implementation
